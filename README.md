<h3>Workflow</h3>
Let's try to work with some guidelines. Once we have something sort of working, we will commit new stuff to a new branch. So if you are improving the way the parser works, you might create a new branch "parser".
Once you are sure it works, you will select "Pull request", and someone else will take a look at it, to ensure we don't put bugs into final version.

After it's merged, it goes into master. Every so often we will update the online server with the changed files in the master branch.

Everything that's in the master branch should be ready for upload and ideally bug-free
